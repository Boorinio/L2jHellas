IMPORTANT: 
	1. If you are using l2jserver unstable and have zone problems look into Fixes folder.
	2. If you have big online, or rank_pvp_system table have 100k+ rows you should rise up java memory limit:
		- open StartGameServer.bat.
		- change -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m for higher:
		
			java -Djava.util.logging.manager=com.l2jserver.util.L2LogManager -Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -cp ./../libs/*;l2jserver.jar com.l2jserver.gameserver.GameServer
			
		- Settings was tested for 1kk rows.
		- Live servers have this value on 8000-16000, but I wrote this info for test servers.
