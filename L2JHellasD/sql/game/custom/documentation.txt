None of these tables will have any effect on your server if you have them disabled from the configurations, so that means nothing is loaded from them, and you can have these tables absent from your database, it won't have any negative effect.

Basically almost all server admins do some kind of changes to their L2J database, and when they want to update their database they always have to worry about conflicting ID's, and issues where they could lose some data they made, i.e  the datapack team perform updates on spawns, npcs, droplists etc.

To overcome this issue, you can put your custom data inside these tables. The L2JDP team won't be changing them too often. These files will just define table structures, so unless we needed to add/remove columns or change column types we won't change them.

Explanation of the table purposes:

custom_armor -> If you modified the stats of an armor you can put the armor here and delete it from the original armor table and safely have it loaded and never touched by retail changes if we do so.

custom_droplist -> same as above description.

custom_etcitem -> same as custom_armor

custom_npc -> If you added a custom npc or modified stats of an existing one, you can put the npc here and delete it from the original npc table and safely have it loaded and never touched by retail npcs. In cases where you created your own npc and Id, you simply don't have to worry about deleting the ID unless if there is an ID in the NPC table that is using that ID.

custom_teleport -> if you add a custom teleport it will be stored here so retail teleports stay untuched.

custom_weapon -> same as custom_armor
