1. PvP System:
	- Added other method for pvp counting. Its secured by time limiter, and basic protections like same IP, clan etc. 
	  This Time Limiter allow kill player every part of time (default 24h). 
	  If killer kill victim and time is OK, so then I call it "Legal Kill", if killer kill again victim, 
	  PvP count rise but not Legall Kill (Time Protection). All informations are stored in DB. 
	  This "Time Protection" should reduce farming.
	  (More: if we set min pvp lvl on 76+ so then it will be hard to farm on bots, anyway protection should
	  reduce farm on low rate servers. If we set max player kills on: 1, it lock Legal Kills counter after 1 kill, 
	  it's mean killer can kill victim only once in game, option can be useful on servers with high online).

	- System works in every place, but is possible to deactivate it in specific areas like: PEACEFUL ZONE.

2. Rank System:
	- Based on PvP System, it's mean, killer can earn exp for kill player, then he rise his rank too if earn 100%. 
	  (exp is based on current Rank Points [RP]).
	- Default 42 ranks.
	- Reward for rise up the Rank can be awarded for each level of Rank Points. 
	  (List of rewards and minimum rank points for obtain reward in database).
	- Included images for ranks and exp bar (loaded from server side).

3. Reward System:
	- Based on PvP System, and each killer rewarded only for Legal Kill. 
	  There is 2 reward types: for Legal Kill player, and for Legal Kill player with Rank
	  (Players with higher ranks can give other rewards or more rewards or both of this option).
	- Each reward types are totally configurable.

4. DeathManager:
	- Is allowed to enable Death Manager, it's mean additional buttons in Death PvP Status Window showing details of killer like 
	  (CP, HP, MP, equipment (enchant) only for kill moment).

5. War Counter:
	- Count kills if target is in War Clan. Legal kills rulez are used. 
	
6. Combo Kill System:
	- Shout messages (local/global) about the killer who doing a combo, all these messages are configurable in config. 
      Combo system allows multiply Rank Points by special ratio defined in config.
