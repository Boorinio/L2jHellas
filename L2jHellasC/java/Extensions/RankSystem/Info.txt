IMPORTANT: 
	1. If you have big online, or custom_pvp_system table have 100k+ rows you should rise java memory limit:
	- open StartGameServer.bat.
	- change -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m for higher:
	
		java -Djava.util.logging.manager=com.l2jserver.util.L2LogManager -Xms2048m -Xmx2048m -cp ./../libs/*;l2jhellas.jar com.l2jhellas.gameserver.GameServer
		
	- Settings was tested for 1kk rows.
	- Big servers have this value on 8000-16000, but I wrote this info for test servers.
